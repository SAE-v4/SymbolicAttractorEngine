# Observer in the Semantic Field

This note describes how a **User Agent (Observer)** can be instrumented to
attune to the **7-dimensional Semantic Field**, using breath and gesture to
resolve coherent expressions.

---

## 1. Semantic Field (7D)

We treat the Semantic Field as a space with axes:

```
[Light, Warmth, Heart, Flame, Inhale, Scale, Witness]
```

- **Tokens** and **glyphs** each carry a 7D vector affinity.  
- **Breath phases** weight axes differently (inhale ↑Light/Heart/Inhale;
  exhale ↑Warmth/Flame; pause ↑Witness/Scale).

## 2. Observer State

Minimal observer state includes:

- **b ∈ R⁷ (bias)** — long-lived tilt (season, being, personal preference).  
- **v_attn ∈ R⁷ (attention)** — the current “pointing” in the field.  
- **α ∈ [0,1] (aperture)** — width of selection cone (breadth vs focus).  
- **κ ∈ [0,1] (cadence lock)** — alignment with breath timing.  
- **p ∈ R⁷ (polarity)** — signed direction impressed by a decisive gesture.  
- **τ (dwell)** — accumulated stillness/hold time at a locus.  
- **θ (seal threshold)** — coherence needed to commit/cross a gate.  
- **v_breath(phase)** — phase-weighted axis vector at the current moment.

## 3. Gesture → Observer Instrumentation

| Gesture | Observer effect | State update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Diagonal cut** (polarity) | Split/decide; orient the basis | set **p := unit(vec_from_stroke)**; κ bumps if near a breath gate |
| **Spiral** (focus) | Concentrate quadrant; accelerate cycle | decrease **α**; add **v_g**; increase **κ** |
| **Heart-hold** (presence) | Dwell; stabilize | increase **τ**; boost Heart/Witness axes |
| **Circle (seal)** | Declare coherence; commit | test coherence ≥ **θ**; emit offering or cross threshold |

## 4. Attunement Loop

**(a) Breath-weighted prior**  
```
v_prior = normalize((1−λ)·b + λ·v_breath(phase))
```

**(b) Gesture influence**  
```
v_mix = normalize(v_prior + g_gain(κ,α)·v_g + gate(p))
```

**(c) Aperture → candidate set**  
- K size = f(α)  
- Softmax temperature = f(α)

**(d) Dwell modulation**  
- τ ↑ → shortlist stabilizes; Heart/Witness weighting ↑.

**(e) Breath gates**  
- At phase transitions, amplify energy (PhaseGlimmer).  
- Gestures landing here = stronger echoes + boosted κ.

## 5. From Attunement to Expression

### A) Pool-mode (witnessing)
- Minimal textual output.  
- Token affinity echoes and ghost glyphs as cues.  
- If **seal** is performed, promote attunement to a **seed**.

### B) Card-mode (coherence)
- Compose phrase vector; score against Being.  
- Select phrase template gated by outcome/phase.  
- Fill placeholders with top tokens/glyphs.  
- Drop echoes to WitnessRadar showing contributing axes.

## 6. Power-user Gesture Quartet

1. **Cut (polarity)** → set p; κ bumps.  
2. **Spiral (focus)** → α narrows; v_attn locks; token affinity ripples confirm resonance.  
3. **Heart-hold (presence)** → τ accumulates; shortlist stabilizes; Witness/Heart ↑.  
4. **Seal (coherence)** → if coherent, emit offering and cross threshold.

This quartet = *open → focus → dwell → seal*.

## 7. Control Law (Summary)

- **Observer** maintains `v_attn` in 7D.  
- **Breath + bias** set prior; **gestures** deform it.  
- **Aperture** governs breadth vs commitment.  
- **Cadence lock** rewards breath-phase alignment.  
- **Hold** stabilizes.  
- **Seal** commits → coherent phrase or soft seed.
