# Gesture Laws

This note clarifies the **gesture families** in the Symbolic Attractor Engine,
their symbolic laws, and how they affect the **Observer** in the Semantic Field.

---

## 1. Swipe / Cut

- **Essence**: Decisive, linear motion.  
- **Law**: **Polarity declaration** — sets a division (left/right, up/down, inner/outer).  
- **Observer effect**: Updates **p** (polarity vector).  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Pool chamber → slicing the semantic field into domains.  
  - Card chamber → decisive coherence test.

## 2. ZigZag

- **Essence**: Alternating direction, rhythmic oscillation.  
- **Law**: **Polarity oscillation** — not just declaring, but *testing both sides*.  
- **Observer effect**: Amplifies polarity axes (like shaking a compass needle).  
  Strongly nudges **κ** (cadence lock) because of rhythmic cadence.  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Witness/Garden lenses → alerting or stressing the field.  
  - Card chamber → flipping outcomes, invoking polarity law.

## 3. Spiral

- **Essence**: Circling inward or outward.  
- **Law**: **Focus law** — draws an area of the field into concentration.  
- **Observer effect**: Narrows **α** (aperture); increases **κ** if in cadence;
  shifts v_attn toward locus.  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Pool chamber → quadrant focus.  
  - Card chamber → accelerating vessel cycle.

## 4. Heart-hold

- **Essence**: Stillness at a point.  
- **Law**: **Presence law** — invites witness, stabilizes turbulence.  
- **Observer effect**: Increases **τ** (dwell); boosts Heart/Witness axes;
  reduces entropy.  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Pool → sustaining a ripple into phrase glimmer.  
  - Card → deepening being-aura.

## 5. Circle (Seal)

- **Essence**: Enclosure.  
- **Law**: **Coherence law** — declaring completion, commitment.  
- **Observer effect**: Tests against coherence threshold **θ**; if met, commits
  offering / crosses threshold.  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Pool and Card → closing loops, sealing coherence, crossing gates.

---

## 6. Flick / Nudge

- **Essence**: Small, sharp, quick impulse.  
- **Law**: **Impulse law** — spark, accent, transient nudge.  
- **Observer effect**: Temporary bump to v_attn without narrowing α; accent
  shimmer.  
- **Where it shines**:  
  - Pool → cymbal-like shimmer, audio accent, echo highlight.  
  - Card → flipping emphasis within a phrase.

## Summary (Conceptual Physics)

- **Swipe (cut)** = Polarity declaration (macro, structural).  
- **Zigzag** = Polarity oscillation (micro, dynamic).  
- **Spiral** = Focus law.  
- **Hold** = Presence law.  
- **Seal** = Coherence law.  
- **Flick** = Impulse law.  

Together these gestures form the **instrumental vocabulary** of the Observer:
they allow the user to carve, oscillate, focus, dwell, seal, and spark within
the 7D Semantic Field, always in resonance with breath.
