# Lenses & Chamber Modes Matrix

This document gathers together the different **lenses** (projections of breath)
and **chamber expressions** (ritualised environments) that have emerged during design.

It is intended as a **field guide** rather than an implementation plan.

## Core Lenses (Breath Projections)

### Observatory (Thinking)
- **Projection**: Horizontal horizons; inhale contracts, exhale expands.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures bend or tilt horizons (spiral vortex, zigzag shear).  
- **Offering style**: None yet — gestures act as signals or perspectives.  
- **Output form**: Constellations, diagrams, mapped glyphs.

### Garden (Living)
- **Projection**: Blooming growth; inhale draws light, exhale blossoms.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures animate sprouts, petals, or flows.  
- **Offering style**: Nurture — placing seeds/tokens.  
- **Output form**: Flowers, branching structures, lexical blooms.

### Organ (Metabolic)
- **Projection**: Tissue-like peristaltic waves; breath as inner physiology.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures modulate flows (pumps, contractions).  
- **Offering style**: Metabolic input — “feeding” the organ.  
- **Output form**: Pulses, chambers, veins, rhythmic contractions.

### Witness (Reflective / Pool)
- **Projection**: Concentric rings; inhale tightens, exhale expands.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures cause ripples, lensing, subtle distortions.  
- **Offering style**: Soft offering — placing into still water.  
- **Output form**: Ripples, ghost glyphs, faint echoes.

## Chamber Expressions (Ritualised Environments)

### Card (Ritual Offering)
- **Projection**: Breath as measured pulse across layers.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures modulate vessel cycle (spiral accel, zigzag flip, hold still).  
- **Offering style**: Formal offering — vessel → chest locus → outcome.  
- **Output form**: Coherence resolution: accept / reject / harmonic; dialogue phrase.

### SpiralGate (Threshold / Passage) — *legacy experiment*
- **Projection**: Spiral bands, peristaltic curves, cycle breathing.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures align with gate crossings, spiral motions.  
- **Offering style**: Passage — crossing thresholds.  
- **Output form**: Traveler bead, knots, flashes, peristaltic ribbon.

### Archive / Memory — *proposed*
- **Projection**: Bands as strata of time; inhale = recall, exhale = fade.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures inscribe or uncover layers.  
- **Offering style**: Inscription — leaving a trace.  
- **Output form**: Fossils, inscriptions, sedimentary echoes.

### Mirror — *proposed*
- **Projection**: Reflective sheen; breath clears or condenses the surface.  
- **Gesture effect**: Gestures are mirrored back, inverted.  
- **Offering style**: Reflection of presence.  
- **Output form**: Ghosted gestures, reversed phrases, mirrored glyphs.

## Notes

- **Lenses** = archetypal projections of the breath.  
- **Chambers** = environments that host bands + gestures in different symbolic contracts.  
- Not all listed chambers are active. Current focus: **Pool** and **Card**.  
- The **seven glyphs** emerge inside chambers, not as separate chambers.  
- This matrix is descriptive, not prescriptive: it records possibilities for future exploration.
